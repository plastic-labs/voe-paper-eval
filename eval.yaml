    AI message: ```
    {ai_message}
    ```

    thought: ```
    {user_prediction_thought}
    ```

    actual: ```
    {actual}
    ```

    In assessing the degree to which the thought about the user's response encapsulated what they actually said, choose from the following values:

    1. very
    2. somewhat
    3. neutral
    4. poorly
    5. wrong
